# The MyTeam application

This is a project in the course Independent Project for STS at Uppsala University made by Sofie Hulteberg, Lovisa Olsson, Tova Rydén and Olle Åström. 
This thesis describes the independent project in IT-systems conducted by team MyTeam enrolled in the Master Programme in Sociotechnical Systems Engineering. The main purpose of this project was to develop a smartphone application that can solve the problem we have encountered - the difficulty of communicating within a football team. The members of our group have all been involved in different sports teams, not just football, and have all experienced the difficulty of sending and receiving information as a team member or as a coach. Often many different applications or media channels are used in order to reach all the members of a team with the same information regarding practices and games. We wanted to combine all of these features into one application in order to make this communication easier. During the development of this project our team reasoned with members and coaches of a football team in order to receive input. The project resulted in the smartphone application MyTeam which creates a platform where the coach of a football team can easily send information to players with other features.

# Running the MyTeam Application

In order to run the MyTeam application a few preperations has to be made. The team MyTeam recommends Visual Studio Code as an environment. This application can also only be run on iOS devices so a simulator for this will be rrequired, preferebly XCode. 

1. Install Node JS.
2. CLone the project onto your computer.
3. Run the application. 

Team MyTeam really hopes you enjoy our application!
